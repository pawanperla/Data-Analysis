## Introduction

Data analysis is a crucial step in deriving insights and making informed decisions from data. This repository provides hands-on examples and tutorials for data analysis using two popular Python libraries:

1. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. You will find a notebook that demonstrates various data manipulation and exploration techniques using Pandas.

2. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a widely-used library for creating visualisations in Python. The notebook in this repository illustrate how to create different types of plots and visualisations to effectively communicate your findings.

## Notebook Descriptions

- [`pandas.ipynb`](PANDAS.ipynb): This notebook covers data manipulation and analysis using Pandas. Topics include data loading, cleaning, filtering, grouping, and basic statistical analysis, as well as some advanced file reading techniques in Pandas.

- [`matplotlib.ipynb`](MATPLOTLIB.ipynb): This notebook focuses on data visualisation using Matplotlib. It demonstrates how to create various types of plots, such as bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, and more.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebooks in this repository, you need the following:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any other Python IDE
- Pandas Package 
- Matplotlib Package
- Excel Package for reading an excel File

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
! pip install pandas
! pip install matplotlib
! pip install numpy
! pip install xlwt openpyxl xlrd

```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd data-analysis
```

3. Launch a Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
