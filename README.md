## Introduction

Data analysis is a crucial step in deriving insights and making informed decisions from data. This repository provides hands-on examples and tutorials for data analysis using two popular Python libraries:

1. **Pandas**: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. You will find notebooks that demonstrate various data manipulation and exploration techniques using Pandas.

2. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a widely-used library for creating visualizations in Python. Notebooks in this repository illustrate how to create different types of plots and visualizations to effectively communicate your findings.

## Notebook Descriptions

- [`pandas.ipynb`](pandas.ipynb): This notebook covers data manipulation and analysis using Pandas. Topics include data loading, cleaning, filtering, grouping, and basic statistical analysis.

- [`matplotlib.ipynb`](matplotlib.ipynb): This notebook focuses on data visualization using Matplotlib. It demonstrates how to create various types of plots, such as bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, and more.

## Requirements

To run the Jupyter notebooks in this repository, you need the following:

- Python (>=3.6)
